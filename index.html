        <p>There's no point in denying it. I'm in love with Clara. Oh man. Doc, we don't belong here! Neither one of us! You know it could still be you that gets shot tomorrow! (He takes out the photograph of the tombstone from his pocket and shoves it in Doc's face.) This tombstone could still be in your future! Marty...the future isn't written. It can be changed; you know that! Anyone can make their future whatever they want it to be. I can't let this one little photograph determine my entire destiny. I have to live my life according to what I believe is right... in my heart. (sighs) Doc...you're a scientist. So you tell me. What's the right thing to do, up here?? (he points to his head.) (thinks and then sighs) You're right, Marty.</p>
